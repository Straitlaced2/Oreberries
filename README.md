# Oreberries

## Basics

### Introduction
Tinkers' Construct added oreberries in 1.7.10, but they dropped this feature
when they moved to newer versions of Minecraft. This fork is different from
josephcsible's 1.12.1 version which adds oreberries and lots of configuration options.
While this fork uses the assets provided josephscilble mods, most of the java code has been completely rewritten. This fork of Oreberries continues to provide the content from josephscibles mod, but it adds aluminum, copper, and tin. It enables smelting of the oreberries in a furnace, and smelting of the metals in Tinkers's Smeltery. This fork is designed to run on Forge 2768 and provides very few configuration options.

### How do I use this mod?
You need Minecraft Forge installed first. Once that's done, just drop
oreberries-1.12.2.jar in your Minecraft instance's mods/ directory and,
optionally, configure it. 

### What settings does this mod have?
This fork one configuration file and two configuration options:
1. enable or disable the tinkers villager
2. enable or disable the silk touch mining requirement.
